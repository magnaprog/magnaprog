# Welcome to Kevin Lee's GitHub Page

I built **agentic AI** and solved complex **time-series** and **signal process** problems for NASA's and Lockheed Martin's space and earth science missions. 

- **Core:** Agentic Orchestration, Quantative Research, Variational Autoencoder, Scientific Reasoning, Anomaly Detection, State Estimation 
- **Tooling:** Python / MATLAB / C++ / R
